    "  In a Python list, all elements are stored together in a block of memory.  \n",

    "### Linked List Big O Summary and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **linked list** is a data structure made of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer (reference) to the next node. The list keeps track of the **head** (the first node) and often the **tail** (the last node).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Head:** Points to the first node in the list.\n",
    "- **Tail:** Points to the last node in the list.\n",
    "- **Pointers:** Each node has a `next` pointer that links to the next node in the chain.\n",

    "|-------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Append new node to end of list      | O(1)    | If you keep a tail pointer, you can add to the end instantly.               |\n",
    "| Remove node at the end              | O(n)    | You must start at the head and walk through the list to find the previous node. |\n",
    "| Add item to beginning               | O(1)    | Just update the new node's next pointer and move the head pointer.          |\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Pointers** connect each node, so you must follow them from the head to reach any node.\n",

    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "Linked lists are great for fast inserts/removes at the beginning (using the head pointer), but slow for searching or accessing by index because you must follow pointers from the head each time. Keeping a tail pointer helps make appending fast, but removing from the end still requires walking through the"

    "- **Node Structure:**  \n",
    "  Each node is a small container that holds a value and a pointer (reference) to the next node.  \n",
